Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold 
one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a 
group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. 
1. Implement and solve the problem optimally using an appropriate search 
algorithm. Is it a good idea to check for repeated states?  
2. Is there a heuristic that would be useful for the missionaries and cannibals 
problem? The generalized missionaries and cannibals problem (n missionaries 
and n cannibals)?
